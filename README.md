# Busymap

Busymap is an interactive web application that allows users to make responsible social distancing decisions. BusyMap.xyz provides its users with a comprehensive and real-time platform to visually represent the busyness of areas in the form of heatmaps. Giving its users control of not just the traditional map controls: zoom and pan, but also the ability to control what hour of day and what day of week they are interested in. That is, enabling users to visualize what areas are crowded during what time of day.
